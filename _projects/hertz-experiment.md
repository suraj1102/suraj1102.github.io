We recreated the famous [Hertz Electromagnetism Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Hertz#Electromagnetic_waves) due to which he was able to prove Maxwell's equations.

We successfully generated and transmitted radio waves using the following apparatus:
- Spark generator obtained from mosquitto racket.
- Flat antenna made of aluminum foil.
- Steel rods as reciever. 

We were able to obtain peaks of over 200 mV on the reciever with a transmitter voltage of 3.3 V.
