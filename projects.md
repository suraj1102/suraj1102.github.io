### Balancing Bot
**System Dynamics and Control Course**  
*April 2025 – May 2025*

Designed and built an autonomous balancing robot based on the cart-pole model, demonstrating mastery of control theory and sensor fusion.

**Technical Highlights:**
- Calculated optimal center of mass using system modeling to minimize rise time
- Implemented Kalman filter for accurate tilt estimation from accelerometer and gyroscope readings
- Characterized stepper motors to find appropriate dead-bands for precise control
- Implemented PID control with Ziegler-Nichols tuning method to reduce oscillations

**Result**: Robot successfully balanced for 2+ minutes while subjected to external forces.

**Skills**: Control Theory, Kalman Filtering, PID Control, Sensor Fusion, Embedded Systems

### Lighter Than Air Systems
**Supervised by Prof. Rajkumar Pant**  
*January 2025 – May 2025*

Designed and fabricated multiple lighter-than-air systems including aerostats, airship envelopes, recovery devices, and launchers.

**Key Achievements:**
- Engineered and deployed a glider with launch mechanism on an aerostat, achieving a **30m glide from 10m altitude**
- Designed and validated an emergency rapid deflation system for airships that quickly deflates the envelope while recovering both payload and envelope material

**Skills**: Aerodynamics, Mechanical Design, Prototyping, Testing & Validation
