### High-Resolution Air Quality Mapping for Smart Cities
**Dixon IoT Lab, Plaksha University**  
*Supervisor: Prof. Srikant Srinivasan*  
*August 2025 – Present*

Contributing to a smart city initiative by developing a dense network of low-cost, weatherproof sensor nodes for urban air quality monitoring.

**Key Contributions:**
- Calibrating 10+ gas and particulate matter sensors against industry-grade modules to ensure measurement accuracy
- Developed an efficient sensor management library to interface with multiple sensors, experimenting with different polling techniques, sampling methods, and sensor settings
- Designed a robust data acquisition and communication pipeline using MQTT protocol, enabling scalable, real-time monitoring across multiple nodes
- Engineering outdoor weather and temperature resilient casings for field deployment

**Research Goal**: Integrate air quality data with existing traffic monitoring networks at Dixon IoT Lab to enable pollution source localization and inform urban planning for improved quality of life.

**Skills**: IoT Systems, Sensor Calibration, MQTT, Embedded Systems, Data Acquisition

### Low Altitude Remote Sensing (LARS) for Precision Agriculture
**Summer Intern, Plaksha University**  
*Supervisor: Prof. Sunita Chauhan*  
*June 2025 – August 2025*

Contributed to a multi-agent robotics project for precision agriculture, developing the autonomous Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) component of a collaborative UAV-UGV ecosystem.

**Key Contributions:**
- Developed a digital twin of the UGV and a 4-DoF manipulator in ROS2/Gazebo, creating a foundational testbed for validating navigation and control strategies prior to hardware deployment
- Engineered and deployed a complete navigation stack (SLAM, localization, path planning) on a physical prototype, bridging the sim-to-real gap
- Led the design, fabrication, and control of the 4-DoF manipulator, implementing a PID position controller to enable precise, targeted interventions based on aerial data

**Research Goal**: Enable the UGV to autonomously act on coordinates provided by a UAV, enabling on-ground inspection and intervention that closes the loop in the remote sensing and response pipeline.

**Skills**: ROS2, Gazebo, SLAM, Navigation, Manipulator Control, PID Control, Digital Twin Development

### An LSTM-based Approach for Real-Time Score Prediction in ODI Cricket
**Machine Learning Course Project**  
*Mentors: Prof. Siddharth, Prof. Brainerd Prince*  
*March 2025 – May 2025*

**Status**: Manuscript in preparation for submission to the *Journal of Sports Analytics*

**Authors**: Arnav Kapoor, Avantika Bansal, Suraj Dayma

Proposed a novel LSTM-based model that incorporates pitch and weather conditions to predict final scores in real-time for ODI cricket matches.

**Key Results:**
- Achieved a state-of-the-art Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of **15.2 runs**, outperforming existing models on a dataset of all ODI matches since 2006
- Conducted a comparative study validating the statistical significance of meteorological and pitch data as predictive features

**Contribution**: This work demonstrates that environmental factors significantly improve prediction accuracy in sports analytics, a key contribution to the field.

**Skills**: Deep Learning, LSTM Networks, PyTorch, Time Series Analysis, Sports Analytics
