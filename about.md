## About Me

I'm a third-year Robotics & Autonomous Systems student at Plaksha University with a strong foundation in robotics, AI, and system design. My work focuses on creating practical solutions that combine hardware, software, and intelligent algorithms.

### Background

I completed my high school education at Global Indian International School in Abu Dhabi, where I was recognized with the **Abu Dhabi Student Golden Visa** for academic excellence. This achievement reflects my commitment to learning and innovation from an early age.

Currently maintaining a **GPA of 8.93/10** at Plaksha University, I've been awarded the **Merit Scholarship** for academic excellence and extracurricular contributions.

### What Drives Me

I'm fascinated by the challenge of bridging the gap between simulation and reality in robotics. Whether it's developing digital twins in ROS2/Gazebo or deploying autonomous systems in the field, I enjoy the process of iterating from concept to working prototype.

My interests span:
- **Autonomous Systems**: Navigation, SLAM, and path planning for mobile robots
- **Computer Vision & Sensing**: Integrating sensors for real-time perception and decision-making
- **IoT & Smart Systems**: Scalable architectures for distributed sensing networks
- **Machine Learning**: Applying deep learning to real-world prediction and control problems
- **Lighter-Than-Air Systems**: Designing aerostats, airships, and novel aerial platforms

### Technical Skills

**Programming**: C, C++, C#, Python (Pandas, PyTorch), Bash, MATLAB

**Robotics**: ROS2, Gazebo Simulator, SLAM, Navigation Stack, PID Control, Kalman Filtering

**Tools**: Git, LaTeX, Unity, CAD (Fusion 360, Onshape), Simscale

**Hardware**: Sensor integration, circuit design, mechatronics prototyping

### Beyond Academics

When I'm not coding or building robots, I'm involved in:
- Teaching and mentoring fellow students as a Mechatronics tutor
- Creating educational content for GeekRoom (former Content Lead)
- Organizing community events like TEDxPlakshaUniversity

### Education

**BTech - Robotics and Autonomous Systems**  
Plaksha University, Mohali | GPA: 8.93/10 | Expected 2027

**Relevant Coursework**: System Dynamics and Control, Sensing and Actuation, Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition, Deep Learning, Computer Networks, Signals and Systems
